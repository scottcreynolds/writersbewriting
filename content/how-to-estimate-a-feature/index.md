One thing that trips developers up at all ranges of experience is estimating how long a given feature will take to build.

1.  Don’t feel pressure to answer right away.
2.  Remember that estimate is a vector not a scalar.
3.  See it from all angles. Make sure you fully understand what needs to be done. Utilize the wisdom of the group. tk
4.  The big paragraph. tk
5.  Say “two weeks”.
