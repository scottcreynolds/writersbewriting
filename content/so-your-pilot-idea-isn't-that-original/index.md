What show is this:

_Boisterous wild-card dad, grounded stay-at-home mom, three kids in varying shades of good/evil and dumb/smart, outlandishly precocious baby, crazy adventures usually centered around dad or evil kid’s poor decision making._

Depending on maybe how old you are, the bulk of you either thought of the _Simpsons_ or _Family Guy_. Tweak some specifics about the baby and it could be the Dunphys of _Modern Family_. Or the _Cleveland Show_ but you probably didn’t watch that. Change the setting and it’s _Bob’s Burgers_.

Take away a kid and add in non-conventional house guest and you could be talking _American Dad_ or _Alf_ (two kids, one alien, same show?), or keep the third kid and the unconventional houseguest and it’s _Mr. Belvedere_ or trade mom for uncle and keep houseguest and it’s _Full House_.

Okay. Change houseguest to always-there neighbor and we have _Family Matters_. Or are we in _Home Improvement_ territory now? Depends on how whether the wacky neighbor gets to drive story or just be a plot device, I guess.



Okay. Let’s go back to the beginning but make the dad a little more grounded and work-focused and you could be describing _Fresh Off the Boat_ or _Black-ish_ (but the mom in the latter has a great job AND is the grounded one), especially if you add in the quirky grandparent (which also keeps us planted in _Simpsons_, _Family Guy_ and _Family Matters_ territory). See also: _Growing Pains_. _Addams Family_. _Roseanne_ (not anymore). _Everybody Loves Raymond_. Others that I can’t think of what do I have all day? (I mean technically, I do.)

Or maybe the family IS the aliens and we’re talkin’ _Third Rock from the Sun_ here. Or the neighbors are aliens in the show that inexplicably got two seasons: _The_ _Neighbors_.

If you take that general family setup as a premise and make just the smallest of changes here and there, you could be describing fully half of all sitcoms ever.

_Two people live together that really have no business living together but here we are._

Is this… the _Odd Couple_? Or is it _King of Queens_ (which is really just the Honeymooners meets the Odd Couple) or _Perfect Strangers_ or, I don’t know, the _Odd Couple_ remake or _Will & Grace_ or the _Will & Grace_ reboot or _Two Broke Girls_ or anyone who lived with Monica during _Friends_.

_A workplace with a crazy boss, a love triangle, an alpha dog, underlings of varying levels of quirky, an HR person that nobody likes…_

_Archer_ or _The Office?_ Take out the HR person and it could be _Taxi_. Change underlings to customers and it’s _Cheers_. Change “crazy” to “quirky” with the boss and sub out the hacky HR person for someone else in the power structure and you can get into _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_ or _Parks and Rec_ territory. You get it.

Okay, fine, but what about one-hour dramas?

More room to play in terms of page count, more formats (there aren’t a lot of half-hour limited series, for instance), so there’s more opportunities to differentiate. And the unique “hook” of the show is often more important in one-hour than in half-hour. But let’s play that game again.

_Quirky/Personality-disordered male character with “special skills” teams up with no-nonsense female cop._

Okay we talkin’ _Lucifer_ here or _Forever_ or _Sleepy Hollow_. Drop the British accent, keep the mystery, watch the _X-Files_ or _Fringe_. Reverse the roles for _iZombie_. Dial down the sci-fi/horror and turn up the thriller and we got _Castle_.



And yeah, procedurals are kind of same-same by design, but even the more unique fare has the DNA of other things all over it. Look at any season of _American Horror Story_ and try not to see that it’s just stitched together from a pile of pre-existing ideas and tropes. It’s unapologetically that.

Let’s not even talk about the fact that a solid majority of shows comes from some other IP directly.

That’s not to say that there’s no original ideas, and that there are no shows that don’t feel fresh and interesting even if they have familiar roots. Usually, the thing that stands out is the _characters_ and how they interact, the choices they make, the drama they create, rather than a given premise specific.

Is _The Good Place_ so good because of the premise? The setting is different but the situations are familiar so it must be the characters. Gregory House was fun to watch because he was House, not because he was Sherlock Holmes with a medical license and a limp in addition to the addiction (and an on-the-nose parallel name). Walter White wasn’t the first family man to break bad, nor was Tony Soprano, but the shows were compelling because the characters were compelling.

I teach a pilot writing class and one of the biggest things people get hung up on is overcomplicating their ideas in some quest to make them _unique_ when that’s not really the point.

Here’s the secret — by and large, we _want_ stories that are familiar, and relatable, so that we can comfortably sink into them and go along for the journey.

Remember that the [_initial idea is just where you start_](https://medium.com/writers-be-writing/idealizing-your-ideas-keeps-you-from-realizing-them-ff4a4103150d). You don’t need to put so much pressure on yourself to come up with that one completely unique premise that will make networks flock to your door clamoring to do your show, because that’s not going to ever be the case. You _definitely_ don’t need to go out of your way to add inorganic elements like “oh it’s _Just Shoot Me_ but the David Spade character is a _ghost_”.

Instead, you just need to take situations and setups that are familiar and relatable — _weird family, dumb boss, starting over, growing up, being young and having friends, following your dreams, solving crimes, doing crimes_ — and create characters and a point of view that comes from **your** perspective, tone, experience, and comedic or dramatic voice.

This is not about having permission to be lazy and not examine your ideas. It’s about not stopping yourself from even exploring them if they’re not something that literally nobody has ever seen before in any form ever. That just isn’t the bar.

Create what you would find interesting and new and fresh in that world. Combine ideas in new ways to create the new thing that has its roots in soil that has already been proven fertile. That’s what we haven’t seen before and what makes the story interesting — the stuff that comes from _you_.

And, I mean, If you do have some great unique original totally new idea then fuck, dude, good for you. Just like, don’t wait for that perfect idea to come to start writing is all I’m saying.
