A frustrating thing I’ve run into over the course of a dozen or so years adopting and refining “agile” and related software practices is how narrow people’s understanding of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) can be, and how that narrow understanding limits their ability to achieve true agility.

When most people think of (or reference) the Agile Manifesto, it’s this part:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
> **Responding to change** over following a plan

The common misstep is to understand this to mean that processes and tools are the enemy, that documentation is wholly unnecessary, that contract negotiation (and relatedly, specification) is a terrible burden (it kind of is) to be avoided, that following a plan is the domain of simple minds that can’t adapt, and that capital-a Agile means Leeroy Jenkins-ing your way through any project.



Before we dispute each of these points, let’s look at the _whole_ Agile Manifesto:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing  
> software by doing it and helping others do it.  
> Through this work we have come to value:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> Working software over comprehensive documentation  
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
> Responding to change over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on  
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

Ah, it’s almost as if the full context is kinda the key to understanding what’s happening here. In the realm of doing software, all of these things have value, but given the choice, the manifesto values one set of principles somewhat more than others. Not taking in the whole thing misrepresents the intent. It would be like acting on the 5th Amendment as though the whole were just the first few bits:

> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime



I think people get caught up in the “over” bit, especially when they don’t read it as “both things have value, but we value the one more”. So, over time, I’ve come to look at the four main statements of the Manifesto in a kind of inverted way:

#### The right processes and tools to support and amplify individuals and interactions

Process isn’t the enemy. Thoughtful application of processes will _enable_ teams to soar rather than hold them back. Process should evolve from real, not imagined needs, and should be an antidote for existing friction rather than a prescription for avoiding an imagined one. Premature optimization applies here as much as it does to your codebase.

Tooling, too, follows this principle. Enough tooling to reduce friction and eliminate wasteful actions. Not so much that it becomes an anchor. A good linting setup will save you time and bugs. A heavily prescriptive project management tool won’t be that helpful if you could just get away with Trello or Post-its on a whiteboard.

Beware any vendor selling solutions with heavy prescriptions in either area. You can’t just “install Agile” and honestly any consultant or company peddling that you can is a crook. Everything has to be thoughtfully applied to the real needs of your team and organization.

#### Just enough documentation to get us to working software

Documentation comes in many forms and the need for it depends on many factors. I’ve worked on agile teams that had to produce extensive docs for regulatory compliance. I’ve worked on teams that had to preserve completed user stories in some format for similar.

Apply a Just-in-time (JIT) model here. Just enough of the thing to move you to the next step. Maybe a big initiative calls for a brief one-pager around which everyone can understand the big picture and goals of the project, and maybe you produce a few high level diagrams of what it might conceptually look like, knowing you’ll be adaptive as you go.

Maybe you write some important docs as you go about how certain dependencies work or why certain choices were made. Maybe your team doesn’t need this kind of thing because you’re very small. Maybe your stories are your documentation. Maybe your tests are.

The point is that documentation isn’t bad. Trying to nail down documenting every little thing and making every choice before you even start building is the practice we want to avoid, but documenting what makes sense when it makes sense and in the format that makes sense is just the practice of professional software development.

#### Just enough contract negotiation and specification that creates space for customer collaboration

Whether it’s with external clients or internal stakeholders, agree in principle (or in writing) on the big picture. Figure out what you need to do to get started. Establish a cadence of collaboration (ad hoc is a cadence and a great one but you can’t always control this) and agree that the process makes room for, and requires, frequent collaboration.

Sometimes you need contracts. Sometimes you need to get funding for a project. These are realities of working for money in a corrupt capitalist society oops I mean … no I meant that. But the goal of this part of the Manifesto is to just try to agree that collaboration is part of the process and that building that into the negotiation is important.

#### Just enough planning to get going with the understanding that change is inevitable

Again we apply JIT wherever possible. We can borrow from Ike and adapt to suit our needs, like all good writers who lean on out-of-context quotes:

> **Plans** are **useless**, but **planning** is indispensable

With planning, a little goes a long way, and should scale to the problem at hand with plenty of room built in for the ol’ adapting to change bit.

I like to think of planning like trip planning. If you need to get to the grocery store, you don’t need to make much of a plan. You know where it is, you go. Maybe you make a list of things you need. Maybe you don’t. If, on the way, there’s road construction, you detour. If they don’t have something you wanted, you either get something else or decide you don’t need it. Minimal project, minimal plan.

If you’re taking a road trip from New York to Los Angeles, you need a little more of a plan. It would be insane to plan every rest stop and refuel to the minute, but you might decide on some milestones along the way like visiting a friend in St. Louis and checking out the Grand Canyon, both of which are things you need to have in mind if only to choose among potential routes. You’re still going to adapt as you go, and if you decide to take another route, you still have your GPS to get you to the ultimate goal.

Plan with the understanding that the further things are in the future, the less clarity you have on them just now, but as you move closer, you can reason about those things with more clarity. This is the essence of Rolling Wave or Progressive Planning. On a ship at sea, the person in the crow’s nest can see farther than the person on the deck, and the navigator with the nautical chart can project further still, but all three operate at different levels of clarity about current conditions, and must work together to ensure a successful voyage.



### Agile is about adaptability, and that includes the Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto exists to be a jumping-off point for your understanding of agile software development. It’s not all-encompassing, it’s not prescriptive, and it certainly should not be treated like a religious artifact, a literal interpretation of which will truly handcuff your efforts to be an agile organization.
